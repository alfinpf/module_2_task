            Oiling your scalp every day is not good if you have acute dandruff. Dandruff is caused by an overgrowth of
            yeast on the scalp, and oil can provide a breeding ground for this yeast to thrive. Instead, it's
            recommended to use anti-dandruff shampoos after oiling your hair.
